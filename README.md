# IoT_based_Home_Security_System

This project implements an IoT-based security system for smart homes, allowing users to control various aspects of their home remotely. The system is developed using Arduino IDE and programmed in C++.

## Features
- **Water Motor Control**: Control the water motor remotely.
- **Light Control**: Turn lights on or off remotely.
- **Door Control**: Open or close doors remotely.
- **Gate Control**: Open or close gates with password protection.
- **Wall Security**: Uses LDR to detect barriers and triggers an alarm.
- **Fire Detection**: Detects fire and triggers an alarm.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage
- Connect to the Arduino board using a web interface.
- Use the interface to control water motor, lights, doors, gates, and monitor wall security and fire detection.
- Follow on-screen instructions for password-protected operations.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino IDE
- C++
